1. [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org)

    Having no experience with markdown, i found this page quite useful to familiarize myself with the syntaxes since this course often requires markdown usage.

2. [RegExr](https://regexr.com/)

    Seems like OS uses RegEx, getting a head start is not a bad idea.
    
3. Reddit's [r/ProgrammerHumor](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/) and [r/MildyInfuriating](https://www.reddit.com/r/MildyInfuriating/)

    Factually the best subreddit.

4. Youtube Channel [LEMMINO](https://www.youtube.com/c/LEMMiNO)

    Arguabily the best docummentary channel in YouTube

5. Youtube Channel [TwoSetViolin](https://www.youtube.com/c/twosetviolin)

    yes.

6. Youtube playlist [Virtual Memory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcBIvnQt0Bw&list=PLiwt1iVUib9s2Uo5BeYmwkDFUh70fJPxX)

    Virtual environment uses virtual memory, say no more.

7. [C language for apes](https://www.learn-c.org)

    Seems like C will be useful in OS, just a hunch, probably.

8. [What is a Fork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(system_call))

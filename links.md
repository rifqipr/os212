# Links

1. [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org)

    Having no experience with markdown, i found this page quite useful to familiarize myself with the syntaxes since this course often requires markdown usage.

2. [RegExr](https://regexr.com/)
    Seems like OS uses RegEx, getting a head start is not a bad idea.
    
3. Reddit's [r/ProgrammerHumor](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/) and [r/MildyInfuriating](https://www.reddit.com/r/MildyInfuriating/)
    Factually the best subreddit.
